## ðŸ’¡ About Fullstack Marathon
Fullstack Marathon is a coding challenge which goal was to teach students frontend and backend web development in 3 months. Starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and ending with a card game project, which is available in my profile. 

Students had up to a week to complete each sprint. After finishing each sprint, they had to check their work with peers, as a result of peer-to-peer learning framework.
