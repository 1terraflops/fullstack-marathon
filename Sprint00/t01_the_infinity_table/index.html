              <td>Orange</td>
              <td>In the Marvel Comics, the orange stone has the power to trap souls, both living and dead. It's a kind of purgatory, keeping them locked away, but also — as Red Skull hints — it has an enduring connection to, and perhaps dominion over, the other gems. This unique ability makes it one of the most mysterious and potentially dangerous of all the Infinity Stones.</td>

              <td>The green Time Stone is the infinity stone that allows Marvel heroes (and villains) to travel anywhere in the future. They can also go back in time and slow down or fast-forward time. In Doctor Strange, the Time Stone is housed within a pendant, the Eye of Agomoto, and is found by Dr. Stephen Strange. With its immense power, it becomes a crucial tool in battles </td>

              <td>The Space Stone, held within a cube-shaped container called the Tesseract, can teleport its holder anywhere they wish. Loki uses this Infinity Stone in The Avengers, and it can also be seen in Captain America when the Red Skull uses its powers. This stone grants near-limitless travel across the universe, making it one of the most coveted artifacts in the Marvel Universe.</td>

              <td>Yellow</td>
              <td>The yellow Mind Stone is all about mind control. It is seen when Loki uses his sceptre in The Avengers, and can control the mind of whoever the sceptre touches. Strangely, the sceptre glows blue, not yellow, and Thanos chose Loki to have this infinity stone. Later, the Mind Stone is revealed to be the source of Vision’s consciousness, granting him incredible intelligence and abilities.</td>

              <td>The Red Infinity Stone, known as the Reality Stone, grants its wielder the power to manipulate reality itself, bending the laws of physics and logic to their will. It can create illusions, alter matter, and even rewrite the fabric of existence on a universal scale. In Thor: The Dark World, the Reality Stone takes the form of a liquid-like substance called the Aether, which Malekith seeks to use to plunge the universe into darkness.</td>

It enhances the wielder's physical abilities and energy projection, making them nearly unstoppable in battle. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the stone is housed within the Orb, which Ronan the Accuser seeks to wield for ultimate destruction.</td>
